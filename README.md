# DamenChat
This is already running on my lanchain environment

TODO:
- Create a new environment, try the requirements txt file and see if it runs with the current libraries -> DONE, requirements.txt is now ready.
- The memory is not working for some reason, the first answer works, but the second one is not
- The app.py has the same problem as streamlit_chatbot.py which is my testing file.
- Modify the code so that we can read a new document using mathpix 


pip install -r requirements.txt
